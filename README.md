Java/C++ learning

        HelloÔºÅI am VictorZhao and I am vert glad to get my GitHub journey started. Today is February 13th,2020. I hope this coronavirus war could end as soon as possible.
        I name  my first repository as java/C++ learning because my goal is to find good projects there and enhance my coding skills. I have graduated from my college and I wish I could find a Java/C++ coder job in ShangHai.
        We all need stack up and try to become the 1%.
